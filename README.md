#  1. Introduction

This project consists of a practical application of advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques in the development of an intelligent agent capable of playing the popular game Connect Four. The project encompasses two main approaches:

###  1.1 Game Description

Connect Four is a game played on a vertical board with 7 columns and 6 rows. Two players take turns, attempting to align four pieces of their color consecutively either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The implementation used in this project was done in Python, with a simple and efficient board representation, allowing quick manipulation and a clear and direct interface for testing and practical demonstrations.

###  1.2 Project Objectives

This project had two main objectives related to Artificial Intelligence:

- **Implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm**  
  The MCTS algorithm was implemented using the UCT (Upper Confidence Bound for Trees) criterion, allowing the agent to make intelligent move decisions in adversarial scenarios.  
  The algorithm systematically explores possible moves, performing multiple simulations to select moves that maximize the probability of winning.

- **Implementation of the ID3 algorithm (Decision Trees)**  
  A decision tree was developed using the ID3 algorithm to automatically learn effective strategies for playing Connect Four based on data previously generated by MCTS.  
  The generated dataset serves as training for the tree, allowing it to identify patterns and recommend future moves with high efficiency. The generated tree is structured in a format easily applicable to new game scenarios.

###  1.3 Project Structure

To achieve these objectives, the following concrete steps were taken:

1. **Implementation of the basic logic of Connect Four:**
   - Development of the board structure and essential methods (victory checking, valid moves, etc.) in Python.

2. **Implementation and fine-tuning of MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search):**
   - Construction of the MCTS agent with detailed explorations and simulations, following the UCT approach.
   - Adjustment of parameters such as the number of simulations to optimize the agent's performance.

3. **Generation of Datasets for Decision Trees:**
   - Using the previously implemented MCTS agent to generate game state examples and optimal decisions.
   - Discretization of continuous or numerical data required for direct application of ID3.

4. **Construction and Application of the ID3 Algorithm:**
   - Detailed development of the decision tree using ID3 on the generated dataset.
   - Validation and practical application of the generated tree in new game scenarios.
